\usage{
download_feed(
  feed_id = NULL,
  provider = NULL,
  country_code = NULL,
  subdivision_name = NULL,
  municipality = NULL,
  exclude_flex = TRUE,
  feed_name = NULL,
  use_source_url = FALSE,
  latest = TRUE,
  status = "active",
  official = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{feed_id}{Character or data frame. The unique identifier for the feed
(e.g., "mdb-2862"), or a single-row data frame from \code{\link[=feeds]{feeds()}} or
\code{\link[=mobdb_search]{mobdb_search()}}. If a data frame is provided, the feed ID will be extracted
automatically. If provided, all other search parameters are ignored.}

\item{provider}{Character. Filter by provider/agency name (partial match).
Use this to search for feeds without knowing the feed_id.}

\item{country_code}{Character. Two-letter ISO country code (e.g., "US", "CA").}

\item{subdivision_name}{Character. State, province, or region name.}

\item{municipality}{Character. City or municipality name.}

\item{exclude_flex}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), automatically exclude feeds
with "flex" in the feed name (case-insensitive). GTFS-Flex feeds are an extension of
the GTFS Schedule specification and may contain files that have unique schemas
that may not work with standard GTFS tools.}

\item{feed_name}{Character. Optional filter for feed name. If provided, only
feeds whose \code{feed_name} contains this string (case-insensitive) will be
considered. Use \code{NULL} (default) to skip this filter.}

\item{use_source_url}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), uses MobilityData's
hosted/archived URL which ensures you get the exact version in their database.
If \code{TRUE}, uses the provider's direct source URL which may be more current
but could differ from MobilityData's version.}

\item{latest}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), download the most recent dataset.
If \code{FALSE}, returns information about all available datasets for the feed.}

\item{status}{Character. Feed status filter: "active" (default), "deprecated",
"inactive", "deprecated", or "future". Only used when searching by provider/location.}

\item{official}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), only return official feeds when
searching by provider/location. If \code{FALSE}, only return unofficial feeds.
If \code{NULL}, return all feeds regardless of official status.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[tidytransit:read_gtfs]{tidytransit::read_gtfs()}}.}
}
\value{
If \code{latest = TRUE}, a \code{gtfs} object as returned by \code{\link[tidytransit:read_gtfs]{tidytransit::read_gtfs()}}.
If \code{latest = FALSE}, a tibble of all available datasets with their metadata.
}
\description{
A convenience function for downloading GTFS Schedule feeds from the Mobility Database. This is a
"one-stop-shop" that can search for feeds by provider/location and download
them in a single call, or download a specific feed by ID.

\strong{Note:} This function is specifically designed for GTFS Schedule feeds only.
GTFS Realtime feeds use a different data model (streaming endpoints rather
than downloadable archives) and are not supported by this function.
\strong{Info:} This function was formerly called \code{mobdb_download_feed()}.
All functions are identical to that function.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Download by feed ID
gtfs <- download_feed("mdb-2862")

# Download from search results
feeds <- feeds(provider = "TransLink")
gtfs <- download_feed(feeds[36, ])

# Search and download by provider name (excludes Flex automatically)
gtfs <- download_feed(provider = "Arlington")

# Download using agency's source URL instead of MobilityData hosted
gtfs <- download_feed(provider = "TriMet", use_source_url = TRUE)

# Include Flex feeds in search
gtfs <- download_feed(provider = "Arlington", exclude_flex = FALSE)

# Filter by location
gtfs <- download_feed(
  country_code = "US",
  subdivision_name = "California",
  municipality = "San Francisco"
)

# Search and download all feeds, including unofficial ones
gtfs <- download_feed(provider = "TTC", official = NULL)

# See all available versions for a feed
versions <- download_feed("mdb-2862", latest = FALSE)
